# PR Code Lines — Claude Code Reference

A GitHub Action that counts the code lines a pull request changes, separating comments and blank lines from code, and tests, generated files, docs, and config from source.

## Code conventions

Conventions live outside this file, synced from https://github.com/bvandrc/bvandrc-conventions — follow all of them:

@conventions/typescript.md — language-level TypeScript/JavaScript rules
@conventions/all.md — practice for every repo: branches, formatting, markdown, PR reviews

`conventions/` is overwritten on every sync. Edit a rule upstream, never in that directory.

`biome.jsonc` extends `conventions/biome.base.json`, so the lint and format rules are synced too rather than restated here. The only local addition is excluding the build output from checks.

## Commands

| Command             | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`     | Bundle `src/` to `dist/index.cjs` with esbuild |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest unit tests                              |
| `npm run lint`      | Biome lint                                     |
| `npm run format`    | Biome format — **run before every commit**     |
| `npm run ts:check`  | TypeScript check                               |
| `npm run check`     | ts + lint                                      |
| `npm run cloc:check`| Compare the pinned cloc release against upstream's latest |

## Gotchas

- **`dist/` is committed on purpose**: a JS action runs its bundle, not its source, so the build cannot be gitignored. `.gitattributes` marks it `linguist-generated` to keep it out of language stats and collapsed in diffs.
- **Rebuild `dist/` in the same change as `src/`**: CI fails if the bundle lags behind the source, since the action runs the bundle.
- **The bundle must stay CommonJS at a `.cjs` path**: `package.json` sets `"type": "module"`, so a CJS bundle at `dist/index.js` is loaded as ESM and throws `require is not defined`.
- **cloc reports a file it could not diff as wholly removed, and still exits 0**: its per-file diff has a timeout (10s by default) and the cost climbs roughly quadratically with changed lines -- 6s at 16k lines, 68s at 50k. A committed bundle blows through the default, and the resulting report reads as if the whole file was deleted. `run.ts` raises the budget to 300s *and* fails on cloc's own `Diff error` lines, since the alternative is publishing a number that is wrong rather than late. Found by this action miscounting its own pull request: 45,333 lines removed where git said 1,979 added.
- **`cloc`'s npm package is not versioned like `cloc`**: the registry's `cloc` package numbers its releases independently of the tool it bundles — `cloc@2.06` ships cloc **1.86**, which reads a rename as a whole file added plus a whole file deleted. `src/cloc/download.ts` pins upstream's release script by URL and sha256 instead; keep it that way. The version and its checksum live in `src/cloc/version.json`, and `cloc-version.yml` opens a pull request when upstream moves on, rewriting that file whole and rebuilding `dist/`. cloc has no programmatic API and never will (it is Perl), and the JS counters that do have one — `sloc` and friends — neither diff two revisions nor survive a `//` inside a string, so a subprocess is the design, not a stopgap.
- **`src/cloc/__tests__/run.test.ts` drives the real cloc against real git history**: it builds throwaway repositories, so it needs `git` and network on first run. The rename case is the regression test for the version trap above.
- **The category patterns are deliberately not inputs yet**: they live in `DEFAULT_CATEGORY_GLOBS` (`src/tally.ts`), and `src/__tests__/tally.test.ts` drives its cases off that constant rather than a copy, so a case is a claim about what users get. Making them configurable is a later change -- it was written and pulled back out, so read issue #5 before rebuilding it.
- **A loose schema should not leak an index signature into its type**: `z.infer` of a `loose()` object carries `{ [k: string]: unknown }`, which makes every typo readable as `unknown`. `run.ts` runs the inference through `OmitIndexSignatureDeep` (`src/utils/type-utils.ts`), so parsing stays tolerant of a new cloc field while the type stays closed and the types stay derived from the schemas. It recurses into a map's values rather than emptying it, since a type whose only keys are an index signature is one the schema asked for. type-fest is a devDependency and ships only declarations, so it costs nothing at runtime.
- **Verify against a real runner, not just unit tests**: build the bundle and run `dist/index.cjs` against a real repository with `INPUT_*`, `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE`, `RUNNER_TEMP`, `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` set. Every bug found so far was invisible to unit tests.
